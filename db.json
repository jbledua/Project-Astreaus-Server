      "content": "No man is an island,\nEntire of itself,\nEvery man is a piece of the continent,\nA part of the main.\nIf a clod be washed away by the sea,\nEurope is the less.\nAs well as if a promontory were.\nAs well as if a manor of thy friend’s\nOr of thine own were:\nAny man’s death diminishes me,\nBecause I am involved in mankind,\nAnd therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls;\nIt tolls for thee."

      "user":"Robert Frost",
      "content": "Whose woods these are I think I know.\nHis house is in the village though;\nHe will not see me stopping here\nTo watch his woods fill up with snow.\nMy little horse must think it queer\nTo stop without a farmhouse near\nBetween the woods and frozen lake\nThe darkest evening of the year.\nHe gives his harness bells a shake\nTo ask if there is some mistake.\nThe only other sound’s the sweep\nOf easy wind and downy flake.\nThe woods are lovely, dark and deep,\nBut I have promises to keep,\nAnd miles to go before I sleep,\nAnd miles to go before I sleep."

      "content": "You may write me down in history\nWith your bitter, twisted lies,\nYou may tread me in the very dirt\nBut still, like dust, I’ll rise.\nDoes my sassiness upset you?\nWhy are you beset with gloom?\n’Cause I walk like I’ve got oil wells\nPumping in my living room.\nJust like moons and like suns,\nWith the certainty of tides,\nJust like hopes springing high,\nStill I’ll rise.\nDid you want to see me broken?\nBowed head and lowered eyes?\nShoulders falling down like teardrops.\nWeakened by my soulful cries.\nDoes my haughtiness offend you?\nDon’t you take it awful hard\n’Cause I laugh like I’ve got gold mines\nDiggin’ in my own back yard.\nYou may shoot me with your words,\nYou may cut me with your eyes,\nYou may kill me with your hatefulness,\nBut still, like air, I’ll rise.\nDoes my sexiness upset you?\nDoes it come as a surprise\nThat I dance like I’ve got diamonds\nAt the meeting of my thighs?\nOut of the huts of history’s shame\nI rise\nUp from a past that’s rooted in pain\nI rise\nI’m a black ocean, leaping and wide,\nWelling and swelling I bear in the tide.\nLeaving behind nights of terror and fear\nI rise\nInto a daybreak that’s wondrously clear\nI rise\nBringing the gifts that my ancestors gave,\nI am the dream and the hope of the slave.\nI rise\nI rise\nI rise."
